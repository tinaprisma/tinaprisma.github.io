# My experience working with SQL in my first data job
Well, it's been quite the 2020 ride, so far, hasn't it?
​
Back in October of last year, I attended an engineering conference and I was lucky enough to be invited to interview in various companies. At the end of the conference, I had two job offers. The whirlwind of emotions that I felt were overwhelming, and I knew that Flatiron had led me to this moment.
​
Interestingly enough, I had not finished my bootcamp at Flatiron when this occurred. I was asked to move in less that two months time to another state to start the job on Jan 6th, 2020. So I did and now I have been working in a major credit card company for the last nine months.
​
I love my job! I can say that technically, I was well prepared to tackle the projects. That said, the SQL I had learned previously looked very different to that used to process big data for a major, international corporation.
​
To start, the number of tables is beyond what I had thought possible, thousands, maybe tens of thousands different tables are available. The company has been around for over 100 years, so we have all kinds of legacy data plus the new data being added as new acquisitions and products enter the scene.  
​
In answering a business question, it is not rare to lack documentation on where to start looking for data. Newbies rely mainly on experienced colleagues to learn what the most reliable datasets are. 
​
Also, some tables are so gigantic, with hundreds of features / columns. Extracting data from one of such tables could take several hours if the queries are not optimized to run in a particular way. For example, we use the notion of "VOLATILE TABLES" to create intermediate steps in the data extraction. This allows for some processing to be done remotely in the database and requires less memory than submitting complex queries.
​
Frankly, when I read the first giant queries available for my team, even though I had studied SQL before, was an intimidating experience. Some queries where hundreds to several thousand lines in length. Many of the production queries I did not understand one bit. 
​
With time, though, and after I forced myself to start writing my own queries, and going over existing queries line by line, I was able to understand and learn. Nowadays, I am able to write my own complex queries. Of course, there is learning yet to happen on the job.
​
So if you think you will have to know everything in data science before you can get a job, think again. You will be presented with projects that test your weaknesses, and with hard work, you will learn more and become a better data scientist while you are on the job!
