You would think everything is rosy in a large corporation regarding systems and data management.

Well, it is not that simple.

Corporations that were established prior to the information age face a particular set of challenges.

1) Processes still dependent on data in legacy systems

A large corporation is a behemoth with many moving parts. When one problem is solved, another arises. In some instances, problems are not solved in a timely fashion because employees don't want to change their workflow or
face any hiccups along the way. Moving to modern system may require extensive planning and usually serious problems arise when migrating processes. So it is easier to avoid evolution. However, this avoidance, when unchecked, may result in outdated systems that are unpopular for the new talent, as well as lack of technical support and maintenance. Over time, not adopting new systems becomes like quicksand, as you try to work in the same space, you sink deeper into the hole.  

2) Limited and confusing documentation

As legacy systems are not maintained, but resources don't move to the new space, the documentation step is often overlooked and individual employee's memories and experiences become the main source of data knowledge. This is not optimal, as it relies too heavily on the employees to be willing to share with new talent. In addition, if the knowledgeable employee leaves the company, that information is lost.

3) Training thwarted by lack of documentation, evolving processes

Without the resources to devote to documentation and migration to new processes, new talent often faces the challenge that they have to learn by the school of hard knocks -- in trial and error fashion. This is a time sink and produces huge frustration for ambitious employees looking to show quick results. The harm to the corporation is that creativity and actual insight decrease, because employees have to deal with basic workflow quirks rather than smooth sailing as it should be.

So be prepared to face these issues and be ready to suggest solutions to your new team, especially if you will join a data-heavy organization that was founded before the 1990s!
